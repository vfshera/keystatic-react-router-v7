# 🚀 Getting Started with Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using plain syntax. Whether you're writing documentation, a README file, or a blog post like this one, Markdown makes it easy to create clean, readable content.

## ✍️ Why Use Markdown?

- It's simple and readable
- Works great with version control (like Git)
- Converts to HTML easily
- Widely supported across tools and platforms

## 🔧 Basic Syntax

### Headers

Use `#` for headers. The number of `#` symbols determines the level:

```markdown
# H1
## H2
### H3
```

### Emphasis

- *Italic* – `*Italic*`
- **Bold** – `**Bold**`
- ~~Strikethrough~~ – `~~Strikethrough~~`

### Lists

**Unordered list:**

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Nested Item
```

**Ordered list:**

```markdown
1. First
2. Second
3. Third
```

### Links and Images

**Link:**

```markdown
[Visit OpenAI](https://openai.com)
```

**Image:**

```markdown

```

### Code

**Inline code:** Use backticks like this: `console.log('Hello!')`

**Code block:**

```js
function greet(name) {
return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## 📚 Blockquotes & Tables

### Blockquote

> Markdown is a writer’s best friend.\
— *Someone on the Internet*

### Table

{% table %}
- Syntax
- Description
---
- Header
- Title
---
- Cell
- Content
{% /table %}

## ✅ Final Thoughts

Markdown is simple but powerful. Once you get the hang of it, you'll never want to go back to writing raw HTML.
